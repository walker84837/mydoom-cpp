# MyDoom-cpp

Hey everyone, welcome to MyDoom-cpp! This is basically MyDoom, but with code converted to C++. This version of MyDoom is based on [yorickdewid's MyDoom](https://github.com/yorickdewid/MyDoom).

## About

MyDoom-cpp is a project that I'm currently working on myself, but if you wanna contribute, feel safe to! I'd love to get more people involved in the development of this project. In order to contribute, just make sure to merge the .c and .h headers in a single .hpp file, which will then be included in `main.cpp`.

## Development

This project will build using a Makefile, so make sure you have that installed on your system. We definitely want to keep all code (including the Makefile) as human-readable and as simple as possible, but still working similar to MyDoom's original C code. Also, try to use the STL as much as possible, since it can make code easier to understand and maintain.

## Acknowledgements

A big thanks to [yorickdewid's MyDoom](https://github.com/yorickdewid/MyDoom) for the original code that MyDoom-cpp is based on. Without that project, this wouldn't be possible!

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to MyDoom-cpp, there are a few things to keep in mind. Make sure to merge the original .c and .h part of the headers in a single (converted) .hpp file, which will then be included in `main.cpp`. Also, try to keep the code as simple as possible and use the STL whenever possible. If you have any questions or need help getting started, don't hesitate to reach out!
